# Memeify
A Javascript based webapp that takes your block of text and turns it into something you can use to mock people. Based off the famous SpongeBob meme.
Memeify uses a random number generator to decide if a particular string index will be capitalized or not. If the outcome of the memeify button isn't good enough, just tap it again.

## New Dank
Now includes "dankify" feature that filters for a particular character and replaces it with a üÖ±Ô∏è emoji. Combined with the memeify feature, these tools can create the most advanced text passages from nearly anything.
